 For WL600 H/W
 1. version: v.01 (updated from v0.1 of WL500)
 2. Conditional compile for WL600(But no test for backward compatible to WL500)
 3. Detect reset to defalut by polling or interrupt(selected by conditional compile)
	and send signal to user space handler

 For new H/W (v1.3) with different GPIO definition of LAN
 1. version: v0.1 (updated from kernel source v1.3 2002040315)
 2. Conditional compile for different Hardware version
 3. LAN algorithm with 4 pots of Ether_Switch
    -- Polling algorithm to check connection state because tx/rx also
       generate interrupt to CPU.
