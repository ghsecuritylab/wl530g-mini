Host AP (software wireless LAN access point) driver for Intersil Prism2

Driver source code is divided into following files:

hostap.o module:

hostap.[ch]

hostap_ap.[ch]
	AP management related functions

hostap_ioctl.c
	ioctl() routines (mostly for Linux wireless extensions support)

hostap_proc.c
	Generic procfs (/proc/net/hostap/wlan#) related routines
	(apart from AP specific proc files in hostap_ap.c)

hostap_config.h
	Common compile time configuration for C preprocessor

hostap_wlan.h
	HFA384x, IEEE 802.11, and driver structures and definitions


hostap_{cs,pci,plx}.o modules:

hostap_hw.c
	Common hardware dependent code. Low-level access routines for HFA384x
	and wrappers for frequently used code. Linux netdevice functions.

hostap_download.c

hostap_cs.c
	Hardware specific routines for PC Card (PCMCIA) version

hostap_pci.c
	Hardware specific routines for Prism2.5-based native PCI version

hostap_plx.c
	Hardware specific routines for PLX-based PC Card adapter version


crypto modules:

hostap_crypt.[ch]
	Registration/unregistration code for modularized encryption
	implementation

hostap_crypt_wep.c
	Host-based WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) implementation



Goal:

hostap_{ap,ioctl,proc,config,wlan}.[ch] should have no hardware
version specific code. In addition, they should have as little as
possible low-level hardware related code.

hostap_hw.c should include all common code shared by different supported
hardware versions. There should be as little as possible hardware
version dependent code (i.e., #ifdefs for PRISM2_{PCCARD,PCI,PLX})

hostap_{pccard,pci,plx}.c should have all hardware version specific
code and as little as possible code that is shared with different
hardware versions.
