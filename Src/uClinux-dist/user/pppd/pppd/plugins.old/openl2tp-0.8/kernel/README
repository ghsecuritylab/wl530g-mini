This PPPoL2TP kernel driver was derived from an early version written
by Martijn van Oosterhout <kleptog@svana.org>. The original version
can be obtained from

http://svana.org/kleptog/kl2tp/kl2tp-0.2.tar.gz

The kernel PPPoL2TP module may be built here for convenience. However,
it is recommended that the module is built in a kernel source tree
using one of the patches in the patches subdirectory.

If you do want to build your PPPoL2TP module here, make sure that
KERNEL_SRCDIR and KERNEL_VERSION are properly defined. See the top
level makefile.

Trying to handle v2.4 and v2.6 kernel builds in this directory is a
nasty hack and will only work for x86 architectures.
