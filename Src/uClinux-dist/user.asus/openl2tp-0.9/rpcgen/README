The rpcgen tool is part of glibc. Unfortunately, some newer versions
of glibc, specificially those distributed with Fedora Linux
distributions, include a buggy rpcgen which segfaults when compiling
OpenL2TP RPC protocol definition files.

As a workaround, sources for rpcgen are distributed with OpenL2TP.
Simply invoke "make" in this directory to build it, then compile
OpenL2TP pointing to this version of rpcgen, i.e.

make
cd ..
make clean
make RPCGEN=rpcgen/rpcgen
