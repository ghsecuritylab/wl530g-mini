Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Edit configurable build options at the top of l2tp_private.h,
   if required. This won't usually be necessary.

2. Edit configurable settings in Makefile if needed, or simply
   override the defaults when invoking make.

3. Edit configurable settings in pppd/Makefile, to point to 
   locally installed pppd sources.

4. Create a symbolic link from /usr/src/linux to your kernel 
   source tree. If you want to build the pppol2tp kernel driver
   statically into your kernel, you must patch your kernel sources
   and build it separately.

5. Build and install the software.

   make
   make install

   This installs the following files:
   /usr/bin/l2tpconfig
   /usr/sbin/openl2tpd
   /usr/lib/openl2tp/ppp_unix.so
   /usr/share/man/man1/l2tpconfig.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man4/openl2tp_rpc.4.gz
   /usr/share/man/man7/openl2tp.7.gz
   /usr/share/man/man8/openl2tpd.8.gz

   To install under a different root directory, say /tmp, use

   make install DESTDIR=/tmp

   The kernel module is not installed by make install. Copy pppol2tp.o
   (2.4 kernels) or pppol2tp.ko (2.6 kernels) to your target system's
   module install directory.

   Unfortunately, some distributions such as Fedora have a broken
   rpcgen utility. If the build fails with a segfault while running
   rpcgen, build the rpcgen tool from the rpcgen subdirectory, then
   re-run make pointing at the local rpcgen.

   cd rpcgen
   make
   cd ..
   make clean
   make RPCGEN=rpcgen/rpcgen

   To cross-compile, define CROSS_COMPILE to be the tool prefix, i.e.

   make CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_7xx-

   You might need to also define READLINE_DIR if readline is not installed
   in the cross compiler tree.

6. Ensure that there are entries for l2tp in /etc/services. There should be
   lines that look like

   l2tp		1701/tcp	l2f
   l2tp		1701/udp	l2f

7. Test the installation. 

   1. Load the kernel module (unless it is built statically into the kernel).

      modprobe pppol2tp

   2. If pppd is being used, test that it can load the pppol2tp plugin.

      /usr/sbin/pppd debug nodetach noauth plugin pppol2tp.so pppol2tp 42

      should output something like:

      Plugin pppol2tp.so loaded.
      Given FD for PPPoL2TP socket invalid (Bad file descriptor)

   3. Start openl2tpd and create a tunnel to itself.
   
      /usr/sbin/openl2tpd

      /usr/bin/l2tpconfig
      l2tp> system show version
      l2tp> tunnel create dest_ipaddr=127.0.0.1
      l2tp> tunnel list

      Note that openl2tpd invokes pppd at /usr/sbin/pppd. If an
      alternative location is required for pppd, openl2tpd must be
      reconfigured and rebuilt as described above.
