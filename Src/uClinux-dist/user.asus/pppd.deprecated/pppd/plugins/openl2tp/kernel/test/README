This directory contains tests to test various aspects of the pppol2tp
Linux kernel module. The subtests are various self-contained tests. If
the tests can run to completion and you can still unload the module,
you must be doing something right!

Tests may be run individually or using tcltest.

The tests are:-

test1: Just load and unload the module
test2: Load module, read proc entry, unload module
test3: Open sockets and close them again
test4: Open sockets, connect, read proc entry and close them
test5: Open sockets, connect, send data through and close
test6: Open two pairs of sockets and connect them and send a packet through tunnel
test7: Open two pairs of sockets and connect tham and trasmit more data
test8: Open a socket pair, then run pppd over them
test9: Test pppol2tp kernel API (getsockopt, ioctl etc)
test10: Create lots of sessions
...

To run the tests as a batch, you can also do

	make test

in this directory. Results go into the results/ subdirectory.
